[Translation Cards](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1tfcNIJqS5TwKk7dqSYu5L1nXv-l-UmeBWa1EgwHMDVQ/edit?usp=drive_web) is an Android app that makes it really easy to record and play back translated words and phrases.

Translation Cards is an in-development tool designed to make it easy for those communicating with someone who speaks another language, providing ready access to pre-recorded translated content just by tapping a card on the screen. This app comes with an initial set of translated and recorded content, oriented towards the medical field. As a user of Translation Cards, you’re also able record their own translations for additional words and phrases.

The need for this tool was born out of [field research](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1lGP95eSvFrQCUTDu2Q4zG1K9vSB6X8lY7cxzyFy9CbU/edit#slide=id.p) done for the European migrant crisis, where field workers lacked a ready way to provide instructions in a foreign language, which Translation Cards seeks to address.
